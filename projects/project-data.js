            <p>A human-robot interaction (HRI) project.</p>
            <p>The user remotely manipulates a puppet of a robot to design expressive movements. 
                Through video conferencing software, the user is able to review the actual robot motion in real-time. 
                The designed motions in our user study are reviewed by a separate group of participants 
                through an online survey.
                The Raspberry Pi-based system achieved low latency.

                For many new origami hobbyists, following step-by-step origami diagrams and watching online video tutorials are two convenient ways to learn how to fold origami models. 
                However, certain diagrams in origami instructions can be confusing, as 2D graphics may not effectively represent certain folds. 
                In the meantime, the quality of online video tutorials can vary. Thus, having additional visual aids to supplement the 2D diagrams and videos may be helpful. 
                This project is a demonstration of the concept, presenting one origami model step-by-step through interactive 3D animation and video tutorials.

                The original origami visualization algorithm was developed by
